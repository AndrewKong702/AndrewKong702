Now you have found the most secret world of Depeng's online sweet home! Let's begin the journey about his life !

## About Depeng
Depeng is a serious and humorous young gay, sorry, a guy who majored in Chinese Language and Literature. 

But his hobby is not just his major "Literature".In 2003, Depeng got his first computer when he was a 5-year-old little boy, and since then he explored on the Internet for over 18 years. The first game he played on PC is ...
3D Pinball on Windows XP！ (/ﾟДﾟ)/ 

### How to play 3D Pinball

1. Type the Letter "H" when you playing the game 
2. 1,000,000,000 points you've got! Surprise! Σ(っ°Д°;)っ

**Sorry** Just a joke o(>ω<)o

## The Real Experience of Playing Games
In fact the first game he played was Counter-Strike, ennnn, that didn't sound like a Children's Game...

It doesn't matter, Depeng always play the games that his friends of the same age never interested in.

But it couldn't stopped him, even without friends who played together with him, Depeng, as a single player, encountered one of the most important person in his life

-- Ezio Auditore da Firenze, in Assassin's Creed II, and Ezio brought him into a all brand new world, and he made more friends in the games from Ubisoft, even more than the number in the reality.

However, it was just a beginning.

## The Way To Become a Game Producer
He read books about how to design a programme on the computer, though he couldn't understand the 'Hecker's Codes' written by programmers, just like in the game "Watch Dogs".

He learned history and literature about all the civilizations, ohhh, that's much easier! Maybe he could be a game scriptwriter! LOL!

He bought "The Game Production Handbook" which was commended by official account of Ubisoft on WeChat, and he learned a lot from that.

He subscribed the GDC channel on YouTube, watched videos and learned how to design a video game that attracts every game player. That's cool.

Now, as a student who majored in Arts of Literature, Depeng study hard in all kinds of computer skills, dreaming of to be a game scriptwriter or designer.

With your help, maybe his dream will come true one day.
